      I have watched a lot of movies, but few movies have stayed with me over
      the years as these have. Take a look at some of my favorite movies
      below.<br /><br />

      1)Gadar : One of Sunny Deol's best movies, it is the story of a Sikh man
      who marries a Pakistani woman who crossed the border by mistake. They
      have a child but they are soon separated as the parents of the girl take
      her back home. How Tara, the protagonist reunites his family is the crux
      of this story.<br /><br />

      2)Koi Mil Gaya: Rohit lost his dad in an accident when he was little, he
      was in the same car, in his mother's womb. Because of the accident,
      Rohit has a disability, even though he is older, his brain is the same
      as a little kid. How Rohit meets an alien, overcomes his problems and
      lets the alien go in a supreme act of self sacrifice is what makes this
      story great.<br /><br />

      3)Lagaan : Aamir Khan plays Bhuvan, a farmer who lives in a village
      taxed heavily by the British. Based in pre-independence India, Bhuvan
      and his friends stake it all on a cricket match between themselves and
      the British, to waive off all their taxes, or'Lagaan'.<br /><br />

      4)Dil Chahta Hai : A tale of three friends, with unique love lives, and
      unique ways of navigating said love lives. A path breaking film which
      represented the youth like they were, away from typical bollywood
      dramatic representation.<br /><br />

      5)Dangal : A father wanted sons so they could carry his legacy as a
      wrestler, forward. However, he was blessed with daughters. How this
      family overcame societal taboo to sire multiple champion athletes is the
      story of Dangal.<br /><br />

      6)Good Will Hunting : Will Hunting is a gifted but poor orphan who works
      as a Janitor at a university. He sneaks around solving complicated math
      on the boards for fun until one of the professors finds him out. FOr the
      first time in his life, Will has a choice, a means to get out of squalor
      and make a life for himself.
