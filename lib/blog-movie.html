      I have watched a lot of movies, but few movies have stayed with me over
      the years as these have. Take a look at some of my favorite movies
      below.<br /><br />

      1)Gadar : One of Sunny Deol's best movies, it is the story of a Sikh man
      who marries a Pakistani woman who crossed the border by mistake. They
      have a child but they are soon separated as the parents of the girl take
      her back home. How Tara, the protagonist reunites his family is the crux
      of this story.<br /><br />

      2)Lagaan : Aamir Khan plays Bhuvan, a farmer who lives in a village
      taxed heavily by the British. Based in pre-independence India, Bhuvan
      and his friends stake it all on a cricket match between themselves and
      the British, to waive off all their taxes, or'Lagaan'.<br /><br />

      3)Dangal : A father wanted sons so they could carry his legacy as a
      wrestler, forward. However, he was blessed with daughters. How this
      family overcame societal taboo to sire multiple champion athletes is the
      story of Dangal.<br /><br />
