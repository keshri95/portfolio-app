            <h3>Vintage Stock Photos</h3>
            <p>
                The 80s and 90s vintage photography styles are slowly making their way back into the graphic design world. You have two options for finding imagery for your vintage-inspired project; either create your own elaborate photoshoot with props, models, and photographers or visit Vintage Stock Photos.
                
                Originally a paid site, Vintage Stock Photos demonetized its incredible collection of images. They own all images, but the resized jpegs posted on their site are free for distribution.
                
                Browse vintage gems by category or popularity, or search for a specific shot.<br /><br />

            <h3>The Public Domain Review</h3>
            <p>
                This non-profit magazine and online journal explore literature, arts, and ideas focusing on the public domain, which means that all out-of-copyright material is now free for the public to enjoy and share.

                The Public Domain Review’s beautiful images and illustrations can be used without restriction and are described as a digital “cabinet of curiosities” that celebrates cultural commons and their creators.

            <h3>Flickr Commons</h3>
            <p>
                “The Commons” has existed since 2008 but is one of the better-kept secrets of the online stock photography community.

                As a result of the pilot partnership with the Library of Congress, the community and project have received overwhelming support and have continued to increase their publicly-held photography collections. Likewise, it is a crowdsourced project where users can add tags and other relevant information.<br /><br />
